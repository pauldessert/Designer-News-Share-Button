- One single self-hosted JS file
- Two lines of code

### Embedding the button

**Step 1**, place the DN link where you want the button appear on the page:

```html
<a href="" class="dn-share-button"></a>
```

**Step 2**, include the javascript file at the end of you HTML. Right before the ```</body>``` tag is a good place:

```html
<script src="/js/dn-button.js"></script>
```
